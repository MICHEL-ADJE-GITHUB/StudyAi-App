### Study Genius - Smart Learning Platform for Students

##What is Study Genius?
Study Genius is a revolutionary learning platform that uses artificial intelligence technologies to deliver a personalized and effective learning experience for students. 

Study Genius aims to revolutionize student learning by making education more accessible, personalized and engaging. Through its innovative platform, students can explore a world of knowledge, develop their skills and reach new academic heights.

##How is Study Genius built?
Developed by Salomon DIEI and Michel ADJETEY, this project is based on a set of powerful tools such as Pinecone, Flutter, FastApi, Langchain and Supabase.

##Main tools used:

- Pinecone: a technology that allowed us to vectorize text and documents that were then stored in indexes by namespaces directly on pinecone. This approach also allowed us to refine the results of treatments by using the search for similarity in our vectors.

- Flutter: Used to develop the Genius mobile study app, it offers students a user-friendly and intuitive interface to access a variety of features. Students can customize their learning experience by defining their goals, preferences and areas of interest.

- Langchain : Pour intégrer et tirer parti des modèles de langages puissants dans l'application.  Il nous a permis d'améliorer la compréhension et l'analyse du contenu éducatif, permettant ainsi une interaction plus riche avec les ressources disponibles.

- FastApi : Pour fournir une API robuste pour Study Genius.

- Supabase : utilisé pour les services d'authentification des utilisateurs, le stockage des données et la gestion de la base de données, garantissant ainsi la sécurité et la confidentialité des informations des utilisateurs. fondir leurs connaissances (Videos, articles, podcast, ect)

List of features:
